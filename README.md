# Substreams Challenge

üìö This challenge is meant for developers with a basic understanding Rust ü¶Ä and Web3.

Do you want to use substreams but don't know Rust? You only need a subset of Rust!

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html)
  Just read and understand chapters 1-9, maybe 10, plus chapters 13 and 18.
- [Rustlings](https://rustlings.cool/) is great to apply what you've learned!

üåä Substreams are a powerful way to process blockchain data efficiently, allowing developers
to stream, transform, and analyze large volumes of on-chain data in real-time.

For a basic introduction to Substreams, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fogh2D-vpzg&t=2122s)

For a quicker, more applicable overview watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWYuOczDiAA&t=27s)

**Create a simple Substreams powered Subgraph:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ You'll be using a template Substreams to filter through blockchain data and indexing the transfer volume of NFT collections.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Then you'll be outputting the target data into a subgraph.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Finally you'll query the subgraph in a template frontend to display the data with swag. üòé

  We recommend using the "All-in-one bash function" to make life easier ü§ô

  > You'll need to install Scaffold-ETH with

  ```sh
  yarn install
  ```

üï∫ Complete the challenge however you want, as long as your result looks the same as ours.

üõ©Ô∏è Follow our steps if you want a more guided experience.

üé£ Our goal (as authors) is not to give you fish, but to teach you to fish.

üß† The challenge will require you to think, problem solve, and try different things.

üöß It's a challenge, not a tutorial. But the goal is that you'll learn more from this challenge than any tutorial could teach.

# üåé Checkpoint 1: map_events üéá

Your first module will be a map_module.

[map_modules](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/develop/manifest-modules#map-modules) are how you will retrieve and filter your data.

When adding new modules, therses

## 1.1 Making a Protobuf üí™

- Protobufs are a language-agnostic way to serialize structured data.
- Substreams use protobufs to carry data through their modules, so we need to define our protobufs in accordance to the data we want.
- [Protobufs](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/develop/creating-protobuf-schemas#protobuf-definition-for-substreams) from the Streamingfast docs.
- In `substreams > proto > contract.proto`, make sure your file looks like this:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

package contract.v1;

message Transfer {
string address = 1;
string name = 2;
string symbol = 3;
}

message Transfers {
repeated Transfer transfers = 1;
}
```

In this challenge your first map_module will return a protobuf called `Transfers`. üöö üöö üöö

Your `Transfers` protobuf is a vector of `Transfer` protobufs.

üç™ When returning a protobuf, you always need to return a single `Protobuf` that contains a vector of `Protobufs`.

üóÉÔ∏è Because substreams index entire blocks at a time before moving to the next block, you need to be able to return multiple protobufs.

## Generating the protobuf

You'll need to run a command to generate the protobufs after defining them.

- [ ] Open your `Makefile`

> This contains commands you will use to build and test your substreams as you go.

- [ ] Generate your protobufs by running:

```sh
make protogen
```

## üç† 1.2 Updating the Yaml

In `substreams_challenge > substreams.yaml`, you'll find the outline of the project structure.
When adding new modules, you'll need to specify its structure in the `substream.yaml`.

The map_module has mostly been filled out.

- [ ] For the name field put `map_events`
- [ ] For the kind field put `map`.

- Your first module will take in `block`s, so the `inputs` field needs `- source: sf.ethereum.type.v2.Block`.
  > Your first module can additionally take in `params` or `clock`, but it will always take in `block`.

Downstream, your map_module's `input` field can take in any of the following [inputs](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/develop/manifest-modules/inputs#inputs-overview).

It is best practice to only take in `sf.ethereum.type.v2.Block` in your first module so you're only iterating over the block in one module.

- The `output:` is `type: proto:contract.v1.Transfers` which is the `Transfers` protobuf.

## 1.3 üèóÔ∏è Building the map_module

- [ ] Go to `substreams_challenge > src > lib.rs`.

> Every module needs a handler above it: `#[substreams::handlers::(map or store)]` so that your yaml finds the module.

### üñäÔ∏è What is filled out:

- Your `map_events` module takes in `blk: eth::Block` (blocks).
- The module returns: `Result<Transfers, substreams::errors::Error>`.
  > map_modules always return [Result Types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/result.html).
- `token_meta` is a helper that makes RPC calls to fetch token `name` and `symbol`.
  > Take a look at rpc.rs if you're curious about how RPC calls work.
- The `Transfer` protobuf is instantiated for you with `name` and `symbol` populated from `token_meta`. In the `address` field `Hex::Encode()` is provided to conveinently convert the address (most likely a `Vec<u8>`) to a hexadecimal string.
- The `Transfers` protobuf (what the module returns) has also been instantiated.
- At the top of file we have imported the `TransferEvent` type for you to use.

## ü•Ö Goal of the module

The module should search the block for all ERC721 transfer events, üéá populate the `Transfer` protobuf with the event address, and populate üë´ the `Transfers` protobuf with a vector of `Transfer` protobufs.

## üéñÔ∏è Your Goals

- [ ] Look at the [available methods](https://docs.rs/substreams-ethereum/latest/substreams_ethereum/pb/eth/v2/struct.Block.html#implementations) on the Block Struct

  > `transactions()`, `reciepts()`, `logs()`, `calls()`, and `events()`, these will allow you to iterate over the block's data.

- [ ] Look at the [Event Trait](https://docs.rs/substreams-ethereum/latest/substreams_ethereum/trait.Event.html) for helpful methods to deal with events.

- [ ] TODO 1: Search üîç the block to find all events that match the `TransferEvent`.

- [ ] TODO 2: Pass the address that emmitted the event üéá into `token_meta` so it can make the calls to the correct address.

- [ ] TODO 3: Assign üßë‚Äçüè´ the `address` field on the protobuf the event address.

- [ ] TODO 4: Assign the `transfers` field üßë‚Äçüåæ on the `Transfers` protobuf the vector of `transfer` protobufs.

## üë∑ Testing your map_module

- [ ] Go back to your Makefile

- [ ] Assign the `MODULE` variable the name of the module you want to test

In the terminal running the following commands will do:

- `make run` will run your module and display the output in the terminal block by block

- `make gui` will run your substreams and allow you to jump to the outputs of specific blocks

üöß For `make run` and `gui`, the `START_BLOCK` needs to be the same as in the `substreams.yaml`

> The STOP_BLOCK will be how many blocks you run

üöß Your API key has a certain limit, so don't test on too large of a block range!

- [ ] Run `make gui` and use TAB to navigate to the Output tab

> You can view the output of each block by using "o" and "p" to scroll left and right accross blocks

- ‚úÖ Check that block #12,287,507 looks like this:

```
{
  "transfers": [
    {
      "address": "890c3b095fb0da2f610f4a3276db0a34591550a2",
      "name": "ROCKY GATEWAY Open Edition by A$AP Rocky",
      "symbol": "ROCKYGATEWAYOPENEDITIONBYAAPROCKY"
    },
    {
      "address": "50b8740d6a5cd985e2b8119ca28b481afa8351d9",
      "name": "RTFKT",
      "symbol": "RTFKT"
    },
    {
      "address": "a7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270",
      "name": "Art Blocks",
      "symbol": "BLOCKS"
    }
  ]
}
```

If it does, you've completed the map_module correctly, congratulations! üéä

üïê Now its time to aggregate the `Transfers` with a store_module!

---

# Checkpoint 2: üè™ store_transfer_volume üîä

The next module you'll be builidng is a store_module.
[store_modules](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/develop/manifest-modules#store-modules) are used to aggregate and store values through the use of key value pairs.

## üç† 2.1 Updating the yaml (again)

- [ ] Go back to the substreams.yaml

This time we only filled out the `initialBlock`. üì•

- [ ] Fill out the `name` with `store_transfer_volume`

- [ ] Fill out the `kind` with `store`

- [ ] üëÄ Look at the [updatePolicy](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/develop/manifest-modules/types#updatepolicy-property) property

  > These are the available options for `updatePolicy`

- [ ] üëÄ Look at the [valueType](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/develop/manifest-modules/types#valuetype-property) property

  > These are the available options for `valueType`

- [ ] üëÄ Look at the [stores](https://docs.rs/substreams/latest/substreams/store/index.html#structs) in the substreams docs.

  üöß Notice: Most of the stores are a combination of an `updatePolicy` and a `valueType`.

  You will be using `StoreAddInt64`.

> NOTE: the [substreams](https://docs.rs/substreams/latest/substreams/index.html).rs library is a different library than the [substreams-ethereum](https://docs.rs/substreams-ethereum/latest/substreams_ethereum/index.html).rs library that you used for the map_modules.

- [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è Now fill out `updatePolicy` and `valueType` appropriately

> üîÑ store_modules take in the same inputs as map_modules.
> üö´ Unlike map_modules, store_modules do not have outputs.

- [ ] Under `inputs` fill in the `-map` field with the name of our map_module

## üè™ 2.2 Building the store_module

- [ ] Go to `substreams_challenge > src > lib.rs`.

### üñäÔ∏è What is filled out:

- Your `store_transfer_volume` module takes in the `transfers: Transfers` protobuf outputted by `map_events`, as the first argument.
- At the top of file we have imported the `StoreAddInt64` type, along with `StoreAdd` and `StoreNew` traits.
  > You need to import the corresponding traits (such as `StoreAdd` and `StoreNew` for `StoreAddInt64`) to use the store types.

### ü•Ö The Goal of the module

The module should iterate over the `Transfers` and for each unique address increment the store value by 1.

### üéñÔ∏è Your Goals

- [ ] Pass in the appropiate store type as the second argument
- [ ] Iterate over transfers
- [ ] Look at the available methods on Docs.rs for your store under the Trait Implementation section
- [ ] Use the `.add()` method on the store you passed in
  > The first argument for `.add()` is ord ([ordinal](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/develop/manifest-modules/writing-module-handlers#ordinal)), we won't be using ordinals so put 0 for that argument.

üöß You cannot use `make run` or `make gui` to test your store_module because they don't have outputs

But we have provided a map_module for the purpose of testing your store_module.

---

# üìà Checkpoint 3: graph_out üõµ

[graph_out](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/consume/subgraph) builds `EntityChanges` that will be outputted into your subgraph.

üöß Notice the handler above `graph_out`, indicates that graph_out is a map_module.

## üç† 3.1 Updating the yaml (again)

- [ ] With your new-found .yaml experience, fill out the rest of the substreams.yaml for graph_out

### schema.graphql

> Your subgraph needs a [schema](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/unit-testing-framework/#example-schemagraphql) to define the entities you'll be querying.

We've provided the following for you:

```graphql
type transfer_volume @entity {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  symbol: String!
  address: String!
  volume: BigInt!
}
```

### ü•Ö Goal of the module

It should iterate ‚ôªÔ∏è over the `Transfers` and for each `Transfer` it should retrieve üèÉ the `volume` from the store, then build the `transfer_volume` entity. üëΩ

### üñäÔ∏è What is filled out:

- The module_returns `Result<EntityChanges, substreams::errors::Error>`
- The `EntityChanges` container has been initialized
- The `Ok` variant returning the `EntityChanges`

### üéñÔ∏è Your Goals

Because stores don't have outputs you'll need to import a new store type to access the storage values. üèòÔ∏è

[Stores](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/develop/manifest-modules/types#store-modes) have two modes for retrieving data. You will be using "get mode" for this module.

- [ ] Look at the library üìö and import the appropriate store type
- [ ] Import the corresponding trait to use the store's methods
- [ ] Pass in the store üè™ as the first function argument
- [ ] Pass in the second argument (look at your yaml)
- [ ] Iterate over the `transfers`
- [ ] Get the volume from the store

  > `EntityChanges` has been imported for you from the [substreams_entity_change](https://docs.rs/substreams-entity-change/latest/substreams_entity_change/index.html).rs library. You will need to use `tables` module to access:

  > 1. `createRow()` on the `Tables` struct, to build the entity
  > 2. `set()` on the `Row` struct, to set the entity's fields

- [ ] Create a row on the table, and set the value of each field
- [ ] Double check your `schema.graphql` to make sure you're populating the entities exactly like the schema

  > The compiler won't catch if the entity you're building matches the schema, so double check for spelling and capitalization.

## üë∑ Testing your graph_out

- [ ] Test your graph_out module with `make gui` and remember to update the `MODULE` variable

- ‚úÖ On the output tab navigate to block #12,287,507 and make it matches this:

```

{
  "entityChanges": [
    {
      "entity": "transfer_volume",
      "id": "890c3b095fb0da2f610f4a3276db0a34591550a2",
      "ordinal": "0",
      "operation": "CREATE",
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "symbol",
          "newValue": {
            "string": "ROCKYGATEWAYOPENEDITIONBYAAPROCKY"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "volume",
          "newValue": {
            "bigint": "6"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "address",
          "newValue": {
            "string": "890c3b095fb0da2f610f4a3276db0a34591550a2"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "name",
          "newValue": {
            "string": "ROCKY GATEWAY Open Edition by A$AP Rocky"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

If it does, congradulations, you have built your first Substreams! üéä
